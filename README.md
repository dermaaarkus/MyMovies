## Description
The app lets you search information about movies and store your favorites. 

## Credits
It was created during a SwiftUI and CoreData Workshop lead by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com). 

The data are provided by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Setup API Key

The Movie Database requieres an api key to authenticate. You must [create your own key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for free.

To make the app use it, please create a `keys.json` file on the project's root level. The file is ignored by git.
```json
{
    "api_key": "<your key>"
}
```
